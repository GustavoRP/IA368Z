### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for IA368Z class at FEEC-UNICAMP (2017/2).



### How do I get set up? ###

All the codes are runing in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and programmed in [Python language](https://www.python.org/).

I recommend installing them by using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). (You can use the latest Anaconda and python 3.6 to ensure the compatibility with my codes)

Further information about the instalation can be found [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html).


After instaling it, please make sure you have the depencies below:

* Dependencies
    * If you are going to run the notebooks in, make sure you are runing Python 2.7 and have all needed packages on your machine. 
    
        * numpy
        * matplotlib
		
* Database configuration
    
    
* How to run tests
	
Please make sure that the folders structure is according to the repository structure.
